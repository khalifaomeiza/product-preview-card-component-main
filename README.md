### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    overflow:hidden;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

```


### Continued development

The areas i would want to focus on in future projects would be in making the design responsive and in ensuring effective time management in coding designs.
